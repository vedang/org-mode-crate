What is this check-in about?

- I'm emptying my mind:
  + This is a "stream of consciousness" note to empty my mind.
  + A foolscap page has 32 ruled lines. Each line should contain 8 words at Max according to Pu La Deshpande. This means that 1 full page should contain 256 words.
  + The Morning Page exercise requires you to write 3 foolscap pages worth of stream of consciousness. This means that I should be writing 768 words here (at least) to meet my target.

  + Capture gratitude here

- I had an insight!
  + Capture insight here
