** TODO My Top Priority / Highlight today
- The way to do this:
  + First write whatever comes to the top of your mind. This is what you are thinking of, so write it down.
  + Now review your (custom/normal) Org Agenda and see if anything on it changes the plans you have made. Update the plan you have written down here.
  + Actually updating your Agenda happens in the next step
- Ideally, I'll pick only one. If I'm feeling ambitious, I'll pick two or three. Pick based on the following:
  - What is truly important? (important for my goals, urgently needs attention)
  - What will give me satisfaction for a job well done? (goal driven)
  - What will give me joy?

** TODO Today's message to myself
Remember your core value: *No more zero days!*
- Write code everyday!
  + Think like a writer. Write 750 lines of code everyday, use =tokei= to confirm that you have done this.
- Exercise everyday. A sick man wants to be healthy!
  + #Goal: "75 by Apr 5" : Hit 75 KG on or before <2024-04-05 Fri>, look dapper at Vishwa's wedding
  + #Goal: "72 by Nov 2" : Hit 72 KG on or before <2024-11-02 Sat>, look dapper at Anuj's wedding.
- Think about the product, not the implementation. Make progress!
