** TODO My Top Priority / Highlight today
- The way to do this:
  + First write whatever comes to the top of your mind. This is what you are thinking of, so write it down.
  + Now review your (custom/normal) Org Agenda and see if anything on it changes the plans you have made. Update the plan you have written down here.
  + Actually updating your Agenda happens in the next step
- Ideally, I'll pick only one. If I'm feeling ambitious, I'll pick two or three. Pick based on the following:
  - What is truly important? (important for my goals, urgently needs attention)
  - What will give me satisfaction for a job well done? (goal driven)
  - What will give me joy?

** TODO Today's message to myself
Remember your core value: No more zero days!
- Write code everyday!
- Exercise everyday. A sick man wants to be healthy!
- Think about the product, not the implementation. Make progress!

** TODO [0/4] The whole day plan for today
